 * org default cascades, the Router clamps by card status, an `auto/*` tier
 * resolves to a concrete model, a `--model=` flag overrides per run, and the
 * models-bump cron can rewrite a ladder under a stored value).
 *
 * a position on [0, 1] has no such problem: 0 is whatever that model calls its
 * cheapest rung and 1 is whatever it calls its most expensive. resolution is a
 * lookup into the model's own published ladder, so the result is always a rung
 * that model actually offers. an invalid effort is unrepresentable rather than
 * merely guarded against.
 *
 * neither harness needs us to know a provider's wire format: claude-code takes
 * `--effort <level>` and opencode takes `--variant <level>`, and each owns the
 * per-model, per-transport translation upstream.
