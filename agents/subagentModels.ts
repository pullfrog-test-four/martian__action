 * Derive a cheaper subagent model override from the orchestrator's resolved
 * model spec.
 *
 * This is a pure registry lookup: every alias in `action/models.ts` declares
 * its own `subagentModel` (alias key in the same provider). At runtime we
 * reverse-lookup the orchestrator's resolved slug to find the alias that
 * produced it, follow the `subagentModel` pointer, and return the target
 * alias's resolve / openRouterResolve depending on which route the
 * orchestrator was using.
 *
 * Returns `{ reviewer: undefined }` when the orchestrator's alias has no
 * `subagentModel` (e.g. it's already at a sufficiently cheap tier, or its
 * provider doesn't have a clean cheaper-but-capable sibling). See models.ts
 * for the wiring + per-provider rationale.
