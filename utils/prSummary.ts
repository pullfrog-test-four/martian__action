/**
 * The PR-level summary snapshot is a markdown file the agent edits in place
 * during a Review / IncrementalReview run. The server seeds the file with
 * either the previous run's snapshot (incremental) or a stub scaffold (first
 * run), lets the agent edit it with its native file-editing tools, then
 * reads it back at end-of-run and persists it to `WorkflowRun.summarySnapshot`.
 *
 * The snapshot is an internal artifact — it is consumed by future agent runs
 * as durable cross-run context, not surfaced to humans. User-visible summary
 * content lives in the Review / IncrementalReview review bodies, governed by
 * `action/modes.ts`.
 *
 * Edit-in-place avoids the output-token tax of a tool call that regurgitates
 * the full snapshot, and gives incremental runs a clean surface that
 * range-diffs cleanly across runs because the section headings are stable.

 * `buildSummaryAddendum`) carries the actual instructions for what to
