/**
 * Where each provider's own account lives, keyed by the provider id the rest of
 * the runtime already uses (`providers` in `models.ts`, `providerID=` in the
 * opencode log). Both failure surfaces read this one table — the per-run PR
 * comment for its top-up CTA, and the diagnosis agent's link registry — so a
 * host move is fixed in one place. Every catalog provider is here except
 * `openai-compatible`, whose endpoint is the customer's own and has no page.
 *
 * How each path is known (2026-09-14), because "checked" means three different
 * things here. Probed with a discriminating control — the path answers 200 and
 * a junk path on the same host 404s: `platform.claude.com`, `platform.kimi.ai`,
 * `www.kimi.com`, `dev.meta.ai`, `opencode.ai`, the AWS billing host.
 * Taken from the provider's own docs, because the host answers a probe with a
 * Cloudflare challenge or a catch-all login redirect that no junk path can
 * distinguish: OpenAI, xAI, DeepSeek, `claude.ai`, `chatgpt.com`, Google,
 * OpenRouter, Vercel, `grok.com`. Fragment routes (`#…`) never reach a server,
 * so those rest on the docs alone. `console.anthropic.com` and
 * `platform.moonshot.ai` both 301 now, so the entries name the hosts they land
 * on.
 *
 * The subscription rows are not providers in the catalog sense — a Claude,
 * ChatGPT or SuperGrok plan has a usage window and a plan page but no API key —
 * so they carry the `-plan` suffix, no `keys`, and the credential that proves
 * the plan is in play.
