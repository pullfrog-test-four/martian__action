/**
 * Provider-agnostic OAuth primitives shared by the Codex and Grok chains.

 * and both rotate their refresh token on every use — so both need the same

/**
 * Thrown when an OAuth provider rejects a refresh token (4xx).
 *
 * `chainIsDead` is decided by the CALLER, because the two providers we talk to
 * disagree about how to say it and only the caller knows its own dialect, and
 * so does the list of rejections that are NOT dead. xAI answers RFC 6749
 * (`{"error":"invalid_grant"}`), so anything else — an unknown client id, an
 * unsupported grant, a CDN error page — is spared. OpenAI answers a dead chain
 * with a `401` whose body varies and is often empty, so there the `401` itself
 * is the signal and only `invalid_client` is spared. Latching wrongly retires a
 * customer's working credential until they re-mint it.
