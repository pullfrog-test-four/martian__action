 * `session.error` — so the run looks alive while doing nothing. A per-request

 * ZERO runs above 60s. 120s is ~3x the observed max and ~14x p90.
 *
 * Note this is NOT the "520s legitimate outlier" figure quoted in #1120 — that
 * measured time to the first LOGGED line (`» thinking` is emitted when the
 * reasoning block *ends*, carrying its own duration), on a runner concurrently
 * busy with `npm ci`. The clock here starts on the first streamed part, which
